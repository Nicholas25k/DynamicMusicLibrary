# DynamicMusicLibrary
An open source music library designed using the .NET framework in C# using WPF for the user interface


Development Setup is Currently in its infancy here, so bare with me as it evolves to hopefully be more straight forward.

To setup your own environment for this project:
1. Download the Express SQL Server Setup by going here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads and selecting the 'Download Now' button under "Express"
2. Pull down this repo into an area of your choice on your computer
3. I recommend installing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, you can find it here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
4. Once all these are installed you'll need to open the included script in Micosoft SQL Server Management Studio and run it. Doing this should initialize the database and make it possible to run the application.
